# Built-In-Self-Test
A built-in self-test (BIST) is a mechanism that permits a circuit to test itself inorder to identify any stuck at faults.This repository contains the verilog modules for different blocks of the BIST with alu.v being the wrapper code and alu_t.v as the test bench. The exact working of the BIST can be seen in project report.
